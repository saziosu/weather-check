# User Experience

The aim of this project is to provide the user with accurate weather information based on the user's selection of the city.
It provides information on current, past and forecasted weather.

## User Stories

* As a first time User, we want to understand immediately what information is required from us to run the app effectively.
  
* As a returning User, we want to be able to input a new city to check the weather for any location we wish to see weather information for.
